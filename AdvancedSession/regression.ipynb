    "Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable (output) is binary.  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dependent variable should be binary in nature (e.g., presence vs. absent).\n",
    "- There should be no outliers in the data, which can be assessed by converting the continuous predictors to standardized scores\n",
    "- There should be no high correlations (multicollinearity) among the predictors.  This can be assessed by a correlation matrix among the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression)."
